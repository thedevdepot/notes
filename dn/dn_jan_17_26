- Learning how to take a daily note in neovim.
- seperated notes into folders for workstation state, development, and cybersecurity
- Just realized the daily learning log should be seperate from the other notes
- I want to code in public by journaling what I am learning on Datalab and other platforms

python

import pandas as pd
names = ['United States', 'Australia', 'Japan', 'India', 'Russia', 'Morocco', 'Egypt']
dr = [True, False, False, False, True, True, True]
cpc = [809, 731, 588, 18, 200, 70, 45]
my_dict = {'country': names, 'drives_right': dr, 'cars_per_cap': cpc}
cars = pd.DataFrame(my_dict)
print(cars)
